About this library
-------------------

Jenkins is the market leading continuous integration system, originally created by Kohsuke Kawaguchi.

Jenkins (and It's predecessor Hudson) are useful projects for automating common development tasks (e.g. unit-testing, production batches) - but they are somewhat Java-centric. Thankfully the designers have provided an excellent and complete REST interface. This library wraps up that interface as more conventional python objects in order to make many Jenkins oriented tasks easier to automate.

This library can help you:

 * Query the test-results of a completed build
 * Get a objects representing the latest builds of a job
 * Search for artefacts by simple criteria
 * Block until jobs are complete
 * Install artefacts to custom-specified directory structures
 * username/password auth support for jenkins instances with auth turned on
 * Ability to search for builds by subversion revision
 * Ability to add/remove/query Jenkins slaves
 * Ability to add/remove/modify Jenkins views

Example
-------

JenkinsAPI is intended to map the objects in Jenkins (e.g. Builds, Views, Jobs) into easily managed Python objects::

	Python 2.7.4 (default, Apr 19 2013, 18:28:01)
	[GCC 4.7.3] on linux2
	Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
	>>> import jenkinsapi
	>>> from jenkinsapi.jenkins import Jenkins
	>>> J = Jenkins('http://localhost:8080')
	>>> J.keys() # Jenkins objects appear to be dict-like, mapping keys (job-names) to
	['foo', 'test_jenkinsapi']
	>>> J['test_jenkinsapi']
	<jenkinsapi.job.Job test_jenkinsapi>
	>>> J['test_jenkinsapi'].get_last_good_build()
	<jenkinsapi.build.Build test_jenkinsapi #77>
