About this library
-------------------

Jenkins is the market leading continuous integration system, originally created by Kohsuke Kawaguchi.

Jenkins (and It's predecessor Hudson) are useful projects for automating common development tasks (e.g. unit-testing, production batches) - but they are somewhat Java-centric. Thankfully the designers have provided an excellent and complete REST interface. This library wraps up that interface as more conventional python objects in order to make many Jenkins oriented tasks easier to automate.

This library allows you to automate most common Jenkins operations using Python.

* Ability to add/remove/query Jenkins jobs
* Ability to execute jobs and:
    * Query the results of a completed build
    * Block until jobs are complete or run jobs asyncronously
    * Get objects representing the latest builds of a job
* Work with build artefacts:
    * Search for artefacts by simple criteria
    * Install artefacts to custom-specified directory structures
* Ability to search for builds by source code revision
* Ability to add/remove/query:
    * Slaves (Webstart and SSH slaves)
    * Views (including nested views using NestedViews Jenkins plugin)
    * Credentials (username/password and ssh key)
* Username/password auth support for jenkins instances with auth turned on
* Ability to script jenkins installation including plugins

Python versions
---------------

The project have been tested and working on Python 2.7, 3.3 and 3.4.
It was tested previously on Python 2.6, so it may work on this version too.

Jenkins versions
----------------

Project tested on both stable (LTS) and latest Jenkins versions.

Known issues
------------
* Job deletion operations fail unless Cross-Site scripting protection is disabled.

For other issues, please refer to the support URL below.

Installation
-------------

Egg-files for this project are hosted on PyPi. Most Python users should be able to use pip or setuptools to automatically install this project.

Using Pip or Setuptools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most users can do the following:

.. code-block:: bash

	pip install jenkinsapi

Or:

.. code-block:: bash

	easy_install jenkinsapi

Both of these techniques can be combined with virtualenv to create an application-specific installation.

Using your operating-system's package manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ubuntu users can now use apt to install this package:

.. code-block:: bash

    apt-get install python-jenkinsapi

Beware that this technique will get a somewhat older version of Jenkinsapi.

Example
-------

JenkinsAPI is intended to map the objects in Jenkins (e.g. Builds, Views, Jobs) into easily managed Python objects:

.. code-block:: python

	>>> import jenkinsapi
	>>> from jenkinsapi.jenkins import Jenkins
	>>> J = Jenkins('http://localhost:8080')
	>>> J.version
	1.542
	>>> J.keys() # Jenkins objects appear to be dict-like, mapping keys (job-names) to
	['foo', 'test_jenkinsapi']
	>>> J['test_jenkinsapi']
	<jenkinsapi.job.Job test_jenkinsapi>
	>>> J['test_jenkinsapi'].get_last_good_build()
	<jenkinsapi.build.Build test_jenkinsapi #77>
	...

More examples available on Github: https://github.com/pycontribs/jenkinsapi/tree/master/examples

Testing
-------

If you have installed the test dependencies on your system already, you can run
the testsuite with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py test

Otherwise using a virtualenv is recommended. Setuptools will automatically fetch
missing test dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

    virtualenv
    source .venv/bin/active
    (venv) python setup.py test

Development
-----------

* Make sure that you have Java_ installed.
* Create virtual environment for development
* Install package in development mode

.. code-block:: bash

    (venv) pip install -e .
    (venv) pip install -r requirements/dev-requirements.txt

* Make your changes, write tests and check your code

.. code-block:: bash

    (venv) nosetests -v jenkinsapi_tests
