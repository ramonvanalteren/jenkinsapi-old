About this library
-------------------

Jenkins is the market leading continuous integration system, originally created by Kohsuke Kawaguchi.

Jenkins (and It's predecessor Hudson) are useful projects for automating common development tasks (e.g. unit-testing, production batches) - but they are somewhat Java-centric. Thankfully the designers have provided an excellent and complete REST interface. This library wraps up that interface as more conventional python objects in order to make many Jenkins oriented tasks easier to automate.

This library can help you:

* Query the test-results of a completed build
* Get objects representing the latest builds of a job
* Search for artefacts by simple criteria
* Block until jobs are complete
* Install artefacts to custom-specified directory structures
* username/password auth support for jenkins instances with auth turned on
* Ability to search for builds by subversion revision
* Ability to add/remove/query Jenkins slaves
* Ability to add/remove/modify Jenkins views

Python versions
---------------

The project have been tested and working on Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.3

Known bugs
----------
* Currently incompatible with Jenkins > 1.518. Job deletion operations fail unless Cross-Site scripting protection is disabled.

Installation
-------------

Egg-files for this project are hosted on PyPi. Most Python users should be able to use pip or setuptools to automatically install this project.

Using Pip or Setuptools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most users can do the following:

.. code-block:: bash

	pip install jenkinsapi

Or:

.. code-block:: bash

	easy_install jenkinsapi

Both of these techniques can be combined with virtualenv to create an application-specific installation.

Using your operating-system's package manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ubuntu users can now use apt to install this package:

.. code-block:: bash

    apt-get install python-jenkinsapi

Beware that this technique will get a somewhat older version of Jenkinsapi.

Example
-------

JenkinsAPI is intended to map the objects in Jenkins (e.g. Builds, Views, Jobs) into easily managed Python objects:

.. code-block:: python

	>>> import jenkinsapi
	>>> from jenkinsapi.jenkins import Jenkins
	>>> J = Jenkins('http://localhost:8080')
	>>> J.version
	1.542
	>>> J.keys() # Jenkins objects appear to be dict-like, mapping keys (job-names) to
	['foo', 'test_jenkinsapi']
	>>> J['test_jenkinsapi']
	<jenkinsapi.job.Job test_jenkinsapi>
	>>> J['test_jenkinsapi'].get_last_good_build()
	<jenkinsapi.build.Build test_jenkinsapi #77>
	...

Testing
-------

If you have installed the test dependencies on your system already, you can run
the testsuite with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

        python setup.py test

Otherwise using a virtualenv is recommended. Setuptools will automatically fetch
missing test dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

        virtualenv
        source .venv/bin/active
        (venv) python setup.py test
